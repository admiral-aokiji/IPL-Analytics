# IPL Analytics Project - Analyzing the miracles, fails and scams of the Indian Premier League

### This project uses the <a href='/'>IPL dataset</a> provided by the The Sparks Foundation that contains ball-by-ball data for each match of the first 12 IPLs. ___All the data cleaning, wrangling and EDA has been done solely using SQL___ and will be visualized in the future using Power BI (or whichever BI tool that interests me then)

Features that may/will be worked upon in the future:
- Link to the dataset that is publicly available to everyone from this README file
- Load the dataset from an AWS S3 instance and then feed the data into an AWS Redshift instance
- Automatic PK generation for deliveries table
- Adding relationships between the tables
